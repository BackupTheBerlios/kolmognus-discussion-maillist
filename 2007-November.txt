Hello all,

As you should have seen it I have just created the list and added you to the 
subscribers' list.

Please post to this list before investing significant time in doing something 
such as coding, in order to avoid wasted effort.

Today I received Arnaud's work on a PyQT GUI. It's not functional yet, but I 
added it on the svn so you can check it out. Blah, I'm still waiting for your 
GTK code, I'm very interested in it.

That's all for now!

joel

Hello!

Thanks a lot for your contribution. I have tested a bit your GTK interface, and 
though it is not yet completely functional, I think we are not far from it 
becomming KolmoGNUS default interface.
I have added your code to the SVN repository. I'd like to add you to the 
commiters list, so you can push your changes directly. For that you will need to 
create a BerliOS account.
A few random remarks:

- The application takes some time to load the stories when it starts, you need 
to show the user something to make him wait. A progress bar would be neat.

- The keyboard shortcuts are missing. I think they are very important, since 
clicking on the buttons is long and cumbersome.

- There is a little bug in the initial training: it has to be done the first 
time the user starts the application only, not every time.

About your question: App.stories is a dictionnary whose keys are link urls and 
whose values are DeliciousStory (item_description.py) objects. These objects 
keep all the information about a specific link. The idea behind this object 
hierarchy is that delicious doesn't need to be the only source of links, so to 
add a new source, you would just need to write a new Story class. It is actually 
quite high on my priority list to allow the user to add custom rss feeds.
