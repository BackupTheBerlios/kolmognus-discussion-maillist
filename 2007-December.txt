Hmph! I am sorry for replying so late but, my weeks tend to be hectic,
and so I do most of my hacking on the weekends. Sorry again for
replying so late!

I read your evaluations about the GTK GUI, and I will definitely heed
them. And also rest assured, I was planning to add in the keyboard
shortcuts, but I was leaving them for last, simply because GTK's
method of polling events for keys is a bit baroque.

Another question. I haven't poked around very deeply into the
internals yet, but I was wondering if it was possible to add
recent/very-recent links into the queue. The stuff from del.ici.ous,
while often very pertinent, is old (I've gotten things from 2005 for
instance), and sometimes I'd like to look for new things that
Reddit/YCombinator just don't have (or their cultures downmod, etc.).
Will there be significant internal hacking needed for this, or is
there a social news site with tagging already implemented that we can
just pop into KolmoGNUS?

I'm sitting down now to continue the hacking, and I've just checked
out the newest SVN, and I'll be continuing on the interface. Again,
sorry for the late reply, and I hope we can make KolmoGNUS an
easy-to-use and effective application.

Oh, and while we stay in this slowly-tangenting thread, I'm registered
as KRoy on Berlios.

Subject: [Kolmognus] GTK Interface Requirements
Message-ID: <b87247c70711302302v57b0fd67gfe82d0a7edfd55d0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm adding a menu into the GTK interface right now, and GTK has 3
different ways to add in menus. Now, the easiest way, an XML
description of the menu, depends on PyGTK 2.4. Is this a sane
requirement to have for our users, or do we want to support older
versions of PyGTK?

Considering that I already depend on python 2.5, I think it's safe. My policy on 
the subject is to add as few dependencies as possible, and not to depend on 
stuff that's not available on mainstream linux distros. So CVS version of 
libraries is not OK, but reasonably recent is :)

Right now, things are piling up on me like no tomorrow, and for the next 2
weeks I'll be swamped by work. My load will lighten significantly after
that, however, and I'll get back to work proper on KolmoGNUS at that point.
Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.

No problem, I've been busy too. I did look for your commit which was supposed to 
happen 16 hours after your last mail, though :)

Anyways, I'll probably get back on it soon too.
